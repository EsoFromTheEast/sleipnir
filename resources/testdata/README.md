`lan.svg`, `mail.svg`, `man.svg` and `vf[FILL,GRAD,opsz,wght].ttf` are copies of files used for internal testing.

`mostly_off_curve.svg` was generated from `mostly_off_curve.ttf`, taken from `font-test-data`.

The svg files were generated using the [hb-draw](https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-draw.html) APIs
orchestrated by a small non-public C++ program.
